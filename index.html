    <h1>Lauren Castro - Learning Module 9 Assignment</h1>
    
    <h2>Have you registered for the upcoming semester yet?</h2>
    <p>Not yet! Some of my classes are not avaliable yet.</p>

    <h2>What classes have you registered for OR what classes do you plan to register for?</h2>
    <p>I plan to register for three classes: Intro To Server Side Programming, Interactive Design and Communications.</p>

    <h2>What are the three most challenging things you've encountered this semester while taking this course?</h2>
    <p>One of the obstacles I've had this semester is remembering what I've just learned. I have to read something over a couple times before I remember it. 
        The second thing I've had trouble with is learning selectors. But I think I finally got the hang of it. And, while unrelated to this course, I am taking Javascript on the side.
        It's very hard to grasp. </p>

    <h2>What do you think of the text book for this course?</h2>
    <p id="one-word">Informative!</p>
